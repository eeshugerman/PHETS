functional variance thing

sample PRF, mean PRF

diff_i = PRF_i - mean_PRF 		(pointwise)


variance = sum(square(diff)) / n	('variance func')

functional COV = variance / mean	('scaled variance func')


integrate(functional COV)		



new plot function:	(statistics)

	like PRFCompare, except:

	one input


	plots:
		mean PRF
		dists squiggle
		variance PRF
		funcitonal covariance


	computes statistics:
		norm of mean
		norm of each sample
		norm of variance func
		norm of functional COV
		variance
		scaled variance		(only scaled with norm of mean ('a' ?)




new plot function:
	parameter curves (last weeks notes)
	
	pane for each:

		norm of mean
		variance

		norm of variance func
		norm of functional COV
		scaled variance


0: clean l2 norm				done

1: check immortal holes to PRF			done

2: make sample PRF				done

3: new functions (above)
