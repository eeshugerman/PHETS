## Synopsis

**P**ersistent **H**omology on **E**mbedded **T**ime-**S**eries

This repository offers high-level tools for exploration and visualization of
* delay coordinate embedding from 1D to 2D
* persistent homology in 2D

and is used to investigate the utilization of these tools together as a signal 
processing technique.

Also included is a dataset of time-series (mostly musical instrument recordings) and 
higher dimensional trajectories in .txt.


3D functionality is under construction.

* ffmpeg


### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eeshugerman/PHETS.git
